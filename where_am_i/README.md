# Where Am I? - Flutter App

## Overview

"Where Am I?" is a simple Flutter application designed to help users find their current geographical location using their device's GPS. The app displays the location on a map and provides an interactive, user-friendly interface to explore different continents.

## Features

- **Real-Time Location**: Fetches the user's current GPS location and displays it on a map.
- **Multiple Screens**: Includes individual screens for different continents (Asia, Africa, Europe, America).
- **Interactive UI**: Provides an intuitive interface with clear call-to-action buttons for users to easily navigate.
- **Location Fetching with BLoC**: Utilizes the BLoC pattern for state management and fetching location data asynchronously.

## Screens

- **Home Screen**: Displays a welcome message and a button to fetch the current location.
- **Map Screen**: Displays the user's current location on a map (integrating the `geolocator` package for location tracking).
- **Asia, Africa, Europe, America Screens**: Different screens representing geographical regions where users can explore various information about those continents.

## Technologies Used

- **Flutter**: The primary framework for building the cross-platform application.
- **flutter_bloc**: For state management using the BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern.
- **Geolocator**: For fetching the user's current location via GPS.
- **Google Maps API**: For displaying the user's location on a map (if integrated).
